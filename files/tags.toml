Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime like Node or Deno. It was built from scratch to focus on three main things:
• Start fast (it has the edge in mind).
• New levels of performance (extending JavaScriptCore, the engine).
• Being a great and complete tool (bundler, transpiler, package manager).

**error: Linux kernel version doesn't support io_uring, which Bun depends on**

To fix this error, you need to update Linux kernel.
If you are using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, do:
  **1.** Open powershell as administrator
  **2.** Run:
     • wsl --set-version <disto name> 2
       • If it throws `Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the BIOS.`, turn on Virtual Machine Platform in Windows Features and then rerun this command.
       • PS: You can get distro name from `wsl --list -v` 
     • wsl --update
     • wsl --shutdown

If that doesn't work (and you're on a Windows machine), try this:
  **1.** Open Windows Update
  **2.** Download any updates to Windows Subsystem for Linux
